# 100-Days-of-Code
Day 0: 09.April.2021 - 09:25
  Today, I decided to start 100 days of code challenge. I don't have any idea about what should I do or what should I study. I am planning to make a plan in this evening. As always I have infinitely more subjects for working on. So, the most challenging thing is choosing one of them. It will be hard.
